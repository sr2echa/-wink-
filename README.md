> At times Our PAST actions ARE not THE BEST ones, THE right ONES, the just ones. At one point everything might seem bleak, yet there is light. 
> It is OUR actions THAT define US, THE CHOICES, our PATH. Our goal - our intension
> The past ACTIONS do NOT justify US. BUT THEY should NEITER define us. 
> May EACH day be a good DAY, A new day A free DAY to BE what we believe and not what we choose.
